## 🌌 Overview

**QUATUMNOS (Creation-Triad)** is a prototype project investigating how an *OS-like kernel* can coordinate **classical + quantum workloads**. It aims to explore:

* Scheduling strategies for hybrid computation
* Quantum resource allocation and management
* Abstraction layers for different quantum backends

⚠️ This is a **research-first** initiative. Expect instability and rapid iteration.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

As quantum hardware matures, we need system-level abstractions to:

* Manage scarce qubit resources efficiently
* Schedule hybrid workloads transparently
* Experiment with OS-inspired policies for distributed & quantum computing

This repo provides a testbed for such explorations.

---

## 🧩 Core Concepts

* **QTask** → Work unit combining classical + quantum stages
* **Hybrid Scheduler** → Decides execution order and backend usage
* **Quantum Resource Manager (QRM)** → Tracks qubits, fidelity, and allocation
* **Adapters** → Pluggable connectors for simulators and quantum SDKs (Qiskit, Cirq, etc.)

---

## ⚡ Features

✅ Lightweight hybrid job scheduling
✅ FIFO & priority-based scheduling
✅ Local simulator backend adapter
✅ Research notebooks & benchmarks
✅ Modular design for future backends

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Virtualenv / Poetry
* (Optional) Qiskit or Cirq

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DEMOTESTERPROJECTS-developerpattaehyung/QUATUMNOS---CREATION-TRIAD.git
cd QUATUMNOS---CREATION-TRIAD
